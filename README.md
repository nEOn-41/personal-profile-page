# Personal Profile Webpage

## Overview

Welcome to my personal profile webpage project! Here, I've created a webpage that displays my basic information, education, and work experience. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it includes sections like "About Me," "Education," "Work Experience," and a contact form that thanks visitors for their message.

## My Learning Journey

This project is more than just code; it's a reflection of my belief in "Learning By Doing." I set out to learn the basics of web development without looking for ready-made solutions, and I found a unique collaborator in ChatGPT, a text-based AI.

### Collaborating with AI

- **Guided Learning**: ChatGPT didn't just hand me the answers; it guided me through the concepts, allowed me to experiment, and stood by as I applied what I learned to the task at hand.
- **Question-Driven Exploration**: I wasn't shy about asking questions. Whenever I had doubts or needed explanations, I questioned and sought clarifications. It made the learning interactive and engaging.
- **Real-Time Application**: I applied my learning directly to the task, reinforcing my understanding through hands-on practice.
